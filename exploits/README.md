# exploits

This folder contains exploits for ```memowotoru```, written in Python, as described in ```memowotoru_patched``` README. <br>
There is a stub flag submitter, and a mock exploit runtime (it works, but it's not enough performant for a real attack/defense CTF). <br>
The main modules to run are three:

- ```mongo_exploit.py```, which exploits mongoDB default credentials;
- ```flask_session_exploit.py```, which exploits Flask default secret key (this is the harder script);
- ```idor_exploit.py```, which exploits IDOR and poor access control.

In the scripts, you can change the list of opponents, which by default is only composed of ```127.0.0.1```.
